	<h2>Author:<b> Fyodor Dostoevsky(11 November 1821 - 09 February 1881)</b></h2>
	<h2>Translated by:<b> Constance Garnett(19 December 1861 - 17 December 1946)</b></h2>
	<p>Released Date:1918</p>
	<p><b>Description</b>: Notes from Underground, also translated as Notes from the Underground or Letters from the Underworld, is an 1864 novella by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Notes is considered by many to be one of the first existentialist novels.It presents itself as an excerpt from the rambling memoirs of a bitter, isolated, unnamed narrator (generally referred to by critics as the Underground Man) who is a retired civil servant living in St. Petersburg. The first part of the story is told in monologue form, or the underground man's diary, and attacks emerging Western philosophy, especially Nikolay Chernyshevsky's What Is to Be Done?. The second part of the book is called "Apropos of the Wet Snow", and describes certain events that, it seems, are destroying and sometimes renewing the underground man, who acts as a first person, unreliable narrator and anti-hero.</p><br/>
	<p class="bk"><b>Synopsis:</b> The anonymous narrator of Notes from Underground is a bitter, misanthropic man living alone in St. Petersburg, Russia, in the 1860s. He is a veteran of the Russian civil service who has recently been able to retire because he has inherited some money. The novel consists of the "notes" that the man writes, a confused and often contradictory set of memoirs or confessions describing and explaining his alienation from modern society.
	Notes from Underground is divided into two sections. The first, "Underground," is shorter and set in the 1860s, when the Underground Man is forty years old. This section serves as an introduction to the character of the Underground Man, explaining his theories about his antagonistic position toward society.</p>
	<p id="bw">The second fragment of Notes from Underground, entitled "Apropos of the Wet Snow," describes specific events in the Underground Man's life in the 1840s, when he was twenty-four years old. In a sense, this section serves as a practical illustration of the more abstract ideas the Underground Man sets forth in the first section. This second section reveals the narrator’s progression from his youthful perspective, influenced by Romanticism and ideals of 'the beautiful and lofty,' to his mature perspective in 1860, which is purely cynical about beauty, loftiness, and literariness in general.Apropos of the Wet Snow” describes interactions between the Underground Man and various people who inhabit his world: soldiers, former schoolmates, and prostitutes. The Underground Man is so alienated from these people that he is completely incapable of normal interaction with them. He treats them with a mixture of disgust and fear that results in his own effacement or humiliation—which in turn result in remorse and self-loathing.</p><br/>

	<ol><b>Character List</b><hr/>
		<li class="flip">The Underground Man</li>
			<div class="panel">The anonymous narrator and protagonist of the novel. The Underground Man is a minor civil servant living in nineteenth-century St. Petersburg who has retired completely into what he calls the 'underground,' a state of total alienation and isolation from society. Severely misanthropic, the Underground Man believes himself to be more intelligent and perceptive than most other people in the world, but he also despises himself and frequently feels himself to be inferior or humiliated</div>
		<li class="flip">Liza</li>
			<div class="panel"> A young prostitute whom the Underground Man tries to rescue after sleeping with her at a brothel. Liza is somewhat shy and innocent despite her profession, and she responds emotionally to the Underground Man's efforts to convince her of the error of her ways. She is naturally loving and sympathetic, but she also has a sense of pride and nobility. </div>
		<li class="flip">Simonov</li>
			<div class="panel"> A former schoolmate of the Underground Man, the only one with whom the Underground Man currently maintains a relationship. The Underground Man sees Simonov as an honest, independent man who is less narrow-minded than most people. Nonetheless, the Underground Man also suspects that Simonov despises him and finds his friendship burdensome. </div>
		<li class="flip">Zverkov</li>
			<div class="panel"> A friend of Simonov’s and another former schoolmate of the Underground Man. Zverkov is a successful officer in the army and well liked by his friends. The Underground Man hated Zverkov during their school days, considering him to be coarse, boastful, and stupid. He is also jealous of Zverkov’s wealth, confidence and popularity. </div>
		<li class="flip">Ferfichkin</li>
			<div class="panel">Another of the Underground Man's former schoolmates and an admirer of Zverkov. In school, Ferfichkin was the Underground Man’s “bitterest enemy.” The Underground Man describes Ferfichkin as impudent, foolish, and cowardly, and notes that Ferfichkin frequently borrows money from Zverkov. </div>
		<li class="flip">Officer</li>
			<div class="panel"> A military officer who treats the Underground Man dismissively in a tavern one night, thereby making himself the object of the Underground Man's obsessive desire for revenge for several years. The Underground Man resents the officer for his rank, wealth, physical prowess, and confidence, but is also intimidated by him for these same reasons, and therefore can never make a move against him. </div>
